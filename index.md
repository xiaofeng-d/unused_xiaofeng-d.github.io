## Xiaofeng Dong

I'm a Ph.D. student at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/), [Department of Physics](https://physics.uchicago.edu/).

I currently work with the [Cosmological Physics and Advanced Computing](https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/) group at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) on physical cosmology large-scale structure of the universe. Before Chicago, I obtained my Bacholor's degree in Science from Department of Physics, [Peking University](http://english.phy.pku.edu.cn/).

### Research Interests
Some of my current research interests include primordial non-gaussianity and the large-scale structure of the unviverse, cosmological theory and simulations combined with high-performance computing, and application of advanced statistical / deep learning methods to the study of physical cosmology.



### Music 

Apart from physics, music has been the most enjoyable element in my life. I'm a member of the [UChicago Chamber Music Program](https://music.uchicago.edu/performance-opportunities/instrumental/chamber-music) where I have participated in piano trios, duet and quintet.  I'm working on a few contemporary music composition projects, in collaboration with my beloved performer friends.  I also arranged for fun a variety of Anime/Comics/Games theme music for small ensembles and orchestra. My posted videos and music over the years have received over 2 million views on online platforms.
